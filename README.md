# html_tutorial_page
I created this project for an assigment of Internet Based Programming Lecture at Bandirma Onyedi Eylul University<br>
about.html is for fun, not a serious job, and it is an example page for navigation bar.
<br><br>
In the html.html it has Code Boxes that you can show/hide or copy the code.<br>
And it has auto generated source codes of some html tag implementations.<br>
You can check generation and automation process in ./assets/js/script.js
